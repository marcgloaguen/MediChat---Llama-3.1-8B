It might have occurred by heavyweight lift or during some activities. Simple analgesic taken. Take rest. Sleep in supine position. Second here Costco Chat Doctor.  Ribs are tender to touch.x-ray also useful. If cough, cold, sore throat present then respiratory infections also has to be ruled out. Treat it symptomatically. If still seems serious then x-ray done for chest. CBC will also be done. If you have yellow sclera, right abdomen pain, anorexia then do your serum liver enzyme study for detecting liver pathology. Avoid stress as it can aggravate pain. I hope you will understand my concern.'}"
